# Logger

This repository contains my projects for the course "Ethics and Regulatory Framework of Health Information Systems" in my MSc.

## Keylogger

The `logger.py` script is a keylogger that captures keystrokes on the system where it is run. It records all the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a log file. This can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring computer activity or analyzing user behavior. Please note that the use of keyloggers should comply with legal and ethical considerations.

## Screenlogger with Mail Functionality

The `mail.py` script is a screenlogger with mail functionality. It periodically captures screenshots of the system's display and sends them via email. This can be used for monitoring or remote surveillance purposes. It is important to note that the use of screenloggers should comply with legal and ethical guidelines, and it is recommended to obtain appropriate consent before using such tools.
